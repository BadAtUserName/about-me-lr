      <h2>Short Bio</h2>
      <img src="PictureOfMe.jpg">
      <p> I am a passionate educator and a skilled wordsmith. With 23 years of classroom experience, I've had the privilege of serving an incredibly diverse body of students. As a freelance writing professional, I've had the opportunity to support clientele with a variety of professional and creative projects. Over the years, I've been drawn, again and again, to the world of tech, having taught tech writing, and having taken on website management for the nonprofit organizations for which I've volunteered. Thus, I am currently working on a coding certification through Code Fellows. When I'm not engaged in work, I'm with my family or busy with one of my creative pastimes.</p>
