      <p> Hello, and welcome to my page. Following is information that should help you to get to know me a little better:<br>
      <br> 
      I am a passionate educator and a skilled wordsmith. With 23 years of classroom experience, I've had the privilege of serving an incredibly diverse body of students. As a freelance writing professional, I've had the opportunity to support clientele with a variety of professional and creative projects. In addition to education and writing, I've been drawn to the world of tech. In the early days of the internet, I tinkered with HTML and built my first website. Since then, I have taken HTML certification, managed and built various websites, and have taught tech writing to IT students. I am so excited to get to working on a coding certification through Code Fellows.<br> 
      <br>
      When I'm not engaged in work or coding studies, I'm spending time with my family or working on one of my creative pastimes. I have studied, taught and performed Arabic dance forms for the past 30+ years. My most recent creative endeavor is crocheting. After my mom passed in 2022, I discovered crochet projects that she had left behind. I've completed a few of her projects and started a few of my own. My most current project is crocheting a gazillion marigolds to honor my mother and our mothers and our Latina heritage this coming Dia de Muertos.
