## About Me

I build an awesome "About Me" web page. It provides a brief overview of my bio, work history and education, and goals.

### Reflections and Comments

#### submission questions here

* How did this go, overall? This went fairly well. It did take longer than I expected. I learned HTML at a time when CSS didn't exist, so I'm used to needing to style HTML within HTML. I start to try to create something within HTML, but have to remind myself that I can do that with CSS. It's been pretty fun figuring out CSS. Additionally, I've used WIX to design my websites most currently... so at the same time CSS is fun, it also feels cumbersome to not be able to just drag and drop and place things where I want.

* What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far? I'm wondering why use HTML and CSS at all if folks can just design their own sites with services like WIX? I'm also wondering why we won't be focusing on HTML or CSS and we'll just be focusing on JavaScript? It seems like in order to apply JavaScript, I should be able to create a solid website for the JavaScript to run through.

*How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment? It took me longer than I thought at first. I spent a lot of time dinking around in HTML, trying to get the layout set up in the grid that I wanted. I was excited to find a YouTube channel that focuses on CSS, so I was able to watch a few of his videos and get some ideas for how to adjust my own code to meet my desired outcomes. The JavaScript was actually pretty straightforward and quick. 

### Daily Journal

* How do you see yourself planning and evaluating your learning? What details will you record and/or measure? How often will you evaluate what you want to learn? I am planning and evaluating my learning by attending Code Fellows. There is no way I could do this on my own. The lessons from Code Fellows and the resources provides are beginning to help me see how I might proceed with individual planning and evaluation in addition to that which Code Fellows provides. I am recording the details of what I learn in a notebook. I reocord reading notes in it, class notes in it, and notes from the additional sources provided by Code Fellows or discovered along the way. 

* This is also a good place to reflect on the tools and resources used and learned: I am very excited to have found the Kevin Powell CSS YouTube channel. He provides so many tutorials that range in length from 5 minutes to nearly two hours. I was thinking I might just watch one per day. I learned so much just from the one video on grids. What I learned wasn't just about grids either. Powell talks about industry nuances as he's explaining the tool/function/code. It help me grasp the industry lingo better. I hope to be able to find a few more resources like this.
